## Aura: A Programming Language Designed for the AI Era

I'll design **Aura** – a language that treats AI as a first-class citizen, embracing non-determinism while maintaining developer control. Aura integrates probabilistic programming, adaptive structures, and seamless AI interaction while preserving traditional programming strengths.

### Core Principles
1. **AI-Native Primitives**: Built-in support for AI operations
2. **Probabilistic by Default**: First-class uncertainty handling
3. **Adaptive Execution**: Context-aware control flow
4. **Human-AI Collaboration**: Transparent AI interaction
5. **Determinism When Needed**: Gradual non-determinism boundaries

### Language Architecture

#### 1. **Type System with Uncertainty**
```python
# Certain types (traditional)
let x: Int = 5

# Uncertain types (AI-generated)
let y: ~String = llm_query("Describe quantum entanglement")

# Distribution types
let z: Distribution<Float> = normal_distribution(mean=0.0, std=1.0)
```

#### 2. **Control Flow Revolution**
**a) Probabilistic Branching**
```python
weigh {
    0.7: { /* High-probability path */ }
    0.2: { /* Alternative path */ }
    0.1: { explore_new_solution() }  # Low-probability exploration
}
```

**b) Adaptive Loops**
```python
# Loop evolves based on runtime feedback
adaptive for i in 1..10 {
    result = ai_step(problem)
    break when confidence(result) > 0.95
    refine problem using result
}
```

**c) Consensus Blocks** (Multi-AI coordination)
```python
consensus {
    model: "gpt-4",
    model: "claude-3",
    model: "self-hosted-expert",
    strategy: majority_vote  # Or weighted_confidence
} -> answer {
    "Solve P vs NP problem"
}
```

#### 3. **AI Integration Primitives**
```python
# Seamless model invocation
let response = ai! {
    model: "vision-transformer",
    input: image_buffer,
    params: { temperature: 0.3, max_tokens: 500 }
}

# Memory-enhanced operations
with ai_context(memory=my_knowledge_base) {
    let analysis = ai_query("Correlate with historical trends")
}
```

#### 4. **Uncertainty-Aware Operations**
```python
# Confidence-bound execution
perform action with confidence > 0.8:
    launch_rocket(simulation_data)

# Uncertainty propagation
let risk_factor = (market_analysis ~* investment) / portfolio_value
```

#### 5. **Self-Evolving Structures**
```python
# Functions that improve over time
@adaptive
fn diagnose_patient(symptoms: ~Symptoms) -> ~Diagnosis {
    base_implementation = traditional_diagnosis(symptoms)
    ai_refinement = llm_refine(base_implementation)
    return ai_refinement with learning_rate=0.1
}
```

#### 6. **Probabilistic Debugging**
```python
observe {
    let result = critical_ai_operation()
} with uncertainty_logger(track_distributions=true)
```

### Key Innovations
1. **Probability-Aware VM**
   - Tracks confidence scores for all values
   - Maintains multiple execution paths
   - Automatic branch probability tuning

2. **AI Runtime Environment**
   - On-demand model orchestration
   - Automatic prompt engineering
   - Shared memory space for AI agents

3. **Gradual Determinism**
   ```python
   # Strict deterministic context
   deterministic {
       // Traditional code
       bank_transfer(amount, account)
   }
   
   # Probabilistic context
   exploratory {
       // AI-generated trading strategy
       execute_trades(ai_strategy)
   }
   ```

4. **Explanation System**
   ```python
   explain why decision_tree_output == "high_risk"
   // Returns: "Input X exceeded threshold Y with 92% confidence
   //           due to pattern Z in historical data"
   ```

### Example: Autonomous Research Agent
```python
fn research_question(question: String) -> Report {
    let sources = ai! {
        task: "find_reliable_sources",
        query: question,
        count: ~Int = 10±2  // Uncertain integer (8-12)
    }
    
    adaptive while !sufficient_coverage(sources) {
        sources += discover_related(sources.last)
    }
    
    consensus {
        model: "summarization_expert",
        model: "domain_specialist",
        strategy: confidence_weighted
    } -> analysis {
        "Synthesize findings from ${sources}"
    }
    
    return generate_report(analysis) 
        with confidence > 0.85 
        else human_review(analysis)
}
```

---

### Safety & Control Mechanisms
1. **Uncertainty Budgets**: Limit probabilistic operation chaining
   ```python
   with uncertainty_budget(max=0.3) {
       // Critical operations
   }
   ```

2. **AI Firewalls**: Protected deterministic zones
3. **Confidence Thresholds**: Mandatory minimums for actions
4. **Explanation Requirements**: Compile-time prompts for justifications

---

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Hybrid Runtime**:
   - Traditional execution engine
   - Probabilistic computation unit
   - AI orchestration layer

2. **Compiler Features**:
   - Uncertainty propagation analysis
   - Confidence dependency graphs
   - Automatic prompt slicing

3. **Developer Tooling**:
   - Probability visualizer
   - AI decision tree explorer
   - Confidence heatmaps

Aura embraces AI's non-deterministic nature while providing guardrails and transparency. It enables developers to harness AI's full potential through specialized constructs while maintaining control where determinism is essential – fundamentally redefining programming for the AI age.
